**Kurakoo is a website where you can make friends (safely) and learn more from people you trust.** It is an online community of people providing answers to questions, just like 'Quora'. **Kurakoo** is specially catered to meet the needs of school/college students. Students from different colleges/universities around the world visit **Kurakoo to ask questions to a community of people who are always ready to answer them.**


## Project Backgroundüí°

In the majority of the colleges and universities across India, thousands of students have many doubts and queries from **"Which branch to choose?"** to **"How to crack interviews?"**. Kurakoo is a one-stop solution for all these problems. It serves as a platform where students can drop in their questions for public view and any person from this vibrant community can help by providing answers to these questions.
