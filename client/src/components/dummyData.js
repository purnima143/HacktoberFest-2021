    question: "Which Engineering colleges are good in Mumbai?",
    answer: "IIT Bombay is definitely number 1.ICT can be placed number 2.But now look at colleges that are under Mumbai University, which take students primarily on Mahrastra CET score.The top 5 spots taken by the autonomous colleges of Mumbai. To attain autonomous status is not easy. A college has to consistently perform in various fields such as scholastic, placements, co-curricular activities and internship opportunities, and have good infrastructure (I did not say CAMPUS, as most colleges have negligible campus size, usually up to 1~3 buildings only), for a minimum number of years. I think minimum period is 10 years for which the college has to perform consistently in the above areas to avail autonomous status."
